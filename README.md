# <p align="center"> AI and REAL Image Classification </p> 
## Introduction
An image classification model that takes an image as an input, and predicts whether the image is real or created by A.I. based on the results from two models.

## Models Developed/Implemented
1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was developed by our team
2. An EfficientNet-based model architecture implemented by our team.

## Project Outline
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between real images and AI-generated images. We will collect datasets of real images and fake images. The data will be preprocessed, normalized, and augmented to enhance training. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we will design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification, and validating performance through a confusion matrix. Finally, the project will include documentation of the process, findings, and suggestions for future improvements.

## Datasets Used
[CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images)) <br>
CIFAKE is a dataset that contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10). The dataset contains two classes - REAL and FAKE.
For REAL, images are collected from Krizhevsky & Hinton's CIFAR-10 dataset. For the FAKE images, the equivalent of CIFAR-10 with Stable Diffusion version 1.4 was generated.
There are 100,000 images for training (50k per class) and 20,000 for testing (10k per class)

[Paintings from 10 different popular artists]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/binukandagedon/paintings-from-10-different-popular-artists)) <br>
This data set is about paintings from 10 different artists. The artists are davinci, frida kahlo, henri matisse, jackson pollock, johannes vermeer, picasso, piere auguste, raphael, rembrandt, and van gough

[ArtStyles-Dataset]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norasami/artstylesdataset/data)) <br>
ArtStyles dataset contains 360 images containing 3 different digital art styles. The art style includes Anime, Comic and Semi Realism

These are AI-generated art images using Midjourney for the month of March 2023. It contains around 660 files

[Detecting AI-generated Artwork]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/detecting-ai-generated-artwork))<br>
This dataset was produced as part of the study "AI Generated Art: Latent Diffusion-Based Style and Detection". It contains 1705 fake images and 1705 real images.

[Midjourney Images & Prompt]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cyanex1702/midjourney-imagesprompt))<br>
This dataset is an extensive collection of pictures produced by using the mid-journey idea. It provides a wide range of varied photos with corresponding prompts that are created automatically by means of an advanced captioning system.This dataset, designed primarily for diffusion model training, is a valuable resource for improving machine learning capabilities in image generation. Using the picture and accompanying cues, researchers can delve into the complexities of training stable diffusion models capable of producing visuals resembling mid-journey scenarios.
